    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, The Architecture List collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
      browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
      request. The Architecture List’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how The Architecture List’s visitors use its website. From time to
      time, The Architecture List may release non-personally-identifying information in the
      aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Architecture List also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
      http://thearchitecturelist.com blog posts. The Architecture List only discloses logged in user
      and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>

    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to The Architecture List’s websites choose to interact with The Architecture
      List in ways that require The Architecture List to gather personally-identifying information.
      The amount and type of information that The Architecture List gathers depends on the nature of
      the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
      http://thearchitecturelist.com to provide a username and email address.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
      transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
      strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
      guarantee its absolute security.

      (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right
      to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
      other users. The Architecture List takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
      the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
