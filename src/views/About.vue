        <h2>What's this?</h2>
        <p>
          Its all started with a
          <strong>simple spreadsheet</strong> with a list of architecture practices around the
          world, shared between friends. Every time someone we knew was looking for a job, we
          pointed them to the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          We quickly saw the potential to make this an awesome resource for our fellow architects,
          students, and clients. That's when The Architecture List started.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning we wanted to make it
          <strong>crowd-sourced</strong>. A list for us, by us. It would turn it into a living
          organism, with much more life and information than a simple curated list.

        <h2 class="pt-8">What's the goal?</h2>
        <p>
          As a start, we just want to give it back to the architecture community. We know how hard
          it is to find jobs in our area, so we want to help you find the offices you'll want to
          apply to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, we would love to create a
          <strong>community</strong> around this list. Check our

        <h2>How to help?</h2>
        <p>
          Just
          <strong>use it and share it</strong>. The more you share, the better it gets. Also, try
          some of these ideas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you know an office,
            <router-link class="link link-inline" to="add">add it to the list</router-link>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see an office you are a fan of,
            <strong>vote it up</strong> to help it with its ranking
          </li>
          <li>If you see some incorrect information, it should be easy to fix it</li>
